I am a software engineer at the [Open Source Robotics Foundation](https://openrobotics.org). I did my graduate studies at Carnegie Mellon University, and am very fond of topics in math, computer science and computer vision, especially in the field of robotics.

In my free time, I enjoy building, learning new things, reading books, climbing walls or playing volleyball.
